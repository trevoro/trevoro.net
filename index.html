      👋 Hi I'm Trevor and I'm a self-taught hacker turned VP of Engineering who
      helps startups transition into resilient teams. My work priorities are to
      create a psychologically safe environment for my staff and peers, invent
      and create new solutions that eliminate
      <strike>bullshit</strike> drudgery 🤖, and to advance my field. By
      focusing on creating a healthy system for people to participate in, we can
      create serendipitous circumstances which foster new ideas and allow us to
      take advantage of the opportunities we generate. I value transparency,
      honesty, accountability, and open-mindedness in myself and in my
      relationships both personally and professionally. My former acts include
      <a href="https://bench.co" target="_blank" />Bench</a> and <a
                                 href="https://joyent.com"
                                 target="_blank">Joyent</a>. I currently act as
                         a Fractional CTO and formally advise several seed to
                         series-A stage startups.
